# #OpenMentorship

**#OpenMentorship** is a simple concept: I’m donating my time and knowledge, free of charge, to anyone who could benefit from it to do good in their lives. What ‘good’ means is up to them. It could mean changing their own circumstance, or pushing for change within their community.

## How to book a session

To book a session with me, simply find a date and time that works for the both of us in my calendar. No fees, no strings attached.

*Please don’t use this time to solicit freelance or partnership work, or ask about confidential information pertaining to me or my employer.*

## How to get involved

If you'd like to offer your mentor services to others, you're awesome! Here's a suggested set of steps to get going for yourself:

* Sign up to a service like [Calendly](https://calendly.com/).
* Decide how much time you would like to donate per week, and which day(s) work best for you. I'm starting with 2 30 minute blocks on Wednesday evenings.
* Let people know! Use **#OpenMentorship** in your social media posts to help potential mentorees find you.
* Help other mentors get set up, or encourage people in your industry to get involved.
* See `My recording setup` and `OM logo` sections below for help and resources.

The more people we get involved, the wider the skills on offer and the greater the impact we can have collectively. Let's be part of something bigger than ourselves.

## My recording setup

I record all sessions via Skype, using GarageBand to mix before exporting. I've chosen this set of tools because I want others to see how easy - and free - it is to record your own sessions. All that's needed is a little piece of software called Soundflower (also free) and about 5 minutes to get everything set up.

[This blog post from OmnyStudio](http://blog.omnystudio.com/post/136572786012/the-ultimate-way-to-record-a-podcast-guest-over-skype) covers everything you'll need to use the Skype/Soundflower/GarageBand pipeline. I use a [Blue Snowball iCE Condenser Microphone](http://a.co/c6mqihx) to capture my audio.

## OM logo

If you're making your own OM page, feel free to use the logo I've made for it. I've included it in the `BRAND` folder of this repo. Take the Illustrator file, change up the colours and add your personal style to it.
