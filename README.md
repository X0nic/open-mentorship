# #OpenMentorship

**#OpenMentorship** is a simple concept: I’m donating my time and knowledge, free of charge, to anyone who could benefit from it to do good in their lives. What ‘good’ means is up to them. It could mean changing their own circumstance, or pushing for change within their community.

## How to book a session

To book a session with me, simply find a date and time that works for the both of us in my calendar. No fees, no strings attached.

*Please don’t use this time to solicit freelance or partnership work, or ask about confidential information pertaining to me or my employer.*

## How to get involved

If you'd like to offer your mentor services to others, thank you! Here's a suggested set of steps to get going for yourself:

* Use a service like [Calendly](https://calendly.com/) and pick a day and time slot each week you can donate (I'm donatin an hour a week to start).
* Let people know! Use **#OpenMentorship** in your social media posts to help potential mentorees find you.
* Help other mentors get set up, or encourage people in your industry to get involved.
