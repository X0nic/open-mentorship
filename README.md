# #OpenMentorship

**#OpenMentorship** is a simple concept: I'm donating my time and knowledge to anyone who could use it. Here are a few areas where I think I might be able to help:

- If you're starting a new online business or digital product and would like some advice or feedback on where to start, or a gutcheck on what you've done so far.
- Feedback or critiques on the user experience or design of your web app, native app, or website (_caution: you'll get my honest opinion_)
- You're a front-end developer and you'd link code-review of your JS or CSS, or would like some help getting started using React or React-Native
- You're thinking about, or have started freelancing in a creative field (design, programming, writing, etc) and want to talk about business from that perspective

## How to book a session

To book a session with me, simply find a date and time that works for the both of us in my calendar. No fees, no strings attached.

*Please don't use this time to solicit freelance or partnership work, ask about confidential information pertaining to me or my clients, or use this as a sales opportunity for your book, software, product, or service.*

## How to get involved

If you'd like to offer your mentor services to others, you're awesome! Here's a suggested set of steps to get going for yourself:

* Sign up to a service like [Calendly](https://calendly.com/).
* Decide how much time you would like to donate per week, and which day(s) work best for you. I'm starting with 2 30 minute blocks on Monday evenings.
* Let people know! Use **#OpenMentorship** in your social media posts to help potential mentorees find you.
* Help other mentors get set up, or encourage people in your industry to get involved.
