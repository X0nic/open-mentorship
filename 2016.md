*31 December, 2016*

As the year draws to a close, I thought it a good opportunity to take a look at how **#OpenMentorship** is doing so far. I'm going to talk about some things I enjoyed, some things I'd like to improve on and some things I've learned.

Let's start with some simple numbers:

* 7 sessions
* 7 males
* 4 recordings (5 in total, but one failed)
* 3 career/advice sessions
* 2 cancellations
* 2 design feedback sessions
* 0 females

### What I enjoyed most

I got to meet and spend some time chatting to people from Algeria, Canada, Greece, Pakistan, The UK and The USA. How amazing is that? The level of impact I had in each session is hard to gauge but I ended each call feeling like I'd helped them as much as I could in the time available.

### What could be improved

Quick clearly, gender diversity was totally one sided. This needs to improve. The same could be said for racial diversity. I'm not entirely sure *how* to do this, so any ideas/advice please hit me up [@adamwhitcroft](https://twitter.com/AdamWhitcroft) on Twitter.

I want anyone to feel completely comfortable reaching out to me.

### What I've learned

Talking to people for the first time is always something I've found difficult. I'm naturally pretty quiet and reserved but this has been a fantastically therapeutic experience so far. At the end of each session I feel more confident, which means I'm more comfortable in the next one.

I plan on talking to more strangers, more often.

### 2017

I kicked this project off mid November of this year, and I couldn't be prouder of how it's gone (issues outlined above notwithstanding). I aim to carry on doing this as long as I have the time to donate to it.

{% include attention.html content="For those who have booked sessions with me, thank you for your time. It's been an incredible experience talking to you and I hope I've helped in some small way." %}

I'll be blocking off most of February for personal reasons, but there are a couple of slots left in January (at the time of writing) and March will open up soon!

Thanks for reading, take care of yourselves.

~ Adam
