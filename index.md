**#OpenMentorship** is a simple concept: I'm donating my time and knowledge to anyone who could use it. If you're currently in, or looking to get into, the design and startup space I'll do my best to offer guidance, advice or feedback.

> I want to help you, but I also want you to help me. Through our conversation I hope to gain insights and an understanding of backgrounds and challenges - either personally or professionally - Iâ€™ve not experienced.

Our conversations can be about anything, there is no agenda. Ask for career advice, feedback on an idea or design or about my creative process. It's your time to do with as you wish[^1], no strings attached, no fees.

## Schedule

I've set aside two 30 minute blocks every Wednesday evening (19:00GMT - 20:00GMT). Sessions can be booked 6 weeks in advance[^2]. If you view my calendar and there are no slots, drop me an email and we'll try work something out.

[^1]: Please don't use this time to solicit freelance or partnership work, or ask about confidential information pertaining to me or my employer.
[^2]: For personal reasons I've blocked off February 2017. I'll open sessions up again at the end of the month.
