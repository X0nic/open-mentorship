**#OpenMentorship** is a simple concept: I'm donating my time and knowledge to anyone who could use it. Here are a few areas where I think I might be able to help:

- You feel you or your business needs an app or website but are unsure where to start
- You want some feedback on the design of something[^1]
- You want some feedback on the Javascript or CSS of something
- You started freelancing and want some advice

Our conversations can be about anything, there is no agenda. Ask for career advice, feedback on an idea or design , about my build tools, whatever. It's your time to do with as you wish[^2], no strings attached, no fees.

## What do I stand to gain?

I want to help you, but I also want you to help me. Through our conversation I hope to gain insights and an understanding of backgrounds and challenges Iâ€™ve not experienced.


## Schedule

I've set aside two 30 minute blocks every Monday evening (19:30MST & 20:30MST), you may book **only one** of these blocks per week. I plan to keep my availability open on Monday nights, but if you book less than a couple of days in advance I may have to cancel. If you view my calendar and there are no slots, drop me an email and we'll try work something out.
