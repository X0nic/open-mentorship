**#OpenMentorship** is a simple concept: I'm donating my time and knowledge to anyone who could use it. Here are a few areas where I think I might be able to help:

- If you're starting a new online business or digital product and would like some advice or feedback on where to start, or a gutcheck on what you've done so far.
- Feedback or critiques on the user experience or design of your web app, native app, or website (_caution: you'll get my honest opinion_)
- You're a front-end developer and you'd link code-review of your JS or CSS, or would like some help getting started using React or React-Native
- You're thinking about, or have started freelancing in a creative field (design, programming, writing, etc) and want to talk about business from that perspective

Our conversations can be about anything, there is no agenda. Ask for career advice, feedback on an idea or design , about my build tools, whatever. It's your time to do with as you wish[^1], no strings attached, no fees.

## What do I stand to gain?

I want to help you, but I also want you to help me. Through our conversation I hope to gain insights and an understanding of backgrounds and challenges Iâ€™ve not experienced.


## Schedule

I've set aside two 30 minute blocks every Monday evening (19:30MST & 20:30MST), you may book up to 1 of these blocks per week. I plan to keep my availability open on Monday nights, but if you book less than a couple of days in advance I may have to cancel. If you view my calendar and there are no slots, drop me an email and we'll try work something out.
