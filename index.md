**#OpenMentorship** is a simple concept: I'm donating my time and knowledge free of charge to anyone who could benefit from it to do good in their lives. What 'good' means is up to them. It could mean changing their own circumstance, or pushing for change within their community.

I'm extremely fortunate; I have skills that are transferable, in demand and have the ability to affect real change in one way or another. It would be irresponsible of me not to put them to as much use as possible.

{% include attention.html content="I want to help people, but I also want them to help me. Through our conversations I hope to learn about, and hopefully gain a better understanding of, the hardships or challenges many face that I'm not exposed to personally." %}

I'll be recording and making these sessions freely available[^1] in the hopes that they will help someone in a similar situation[^2].

If you'd like to help, [share this page](http://twitter.com/share?text=Read about %23OpenMentorship, a project by @adamwhitcroft) or - even better - get involved yourself[^3].

[^1]: Sessions will only be recorded and released with the consent of the mentoree.
[^2]: Please don't use this time to solicit freelance or partnership work, or ask about confidential information pertaining to me or my employer.
[^3]: Consider offering your time and services to others for free too. An hour a week could make a huge difference to someone, and is very easily manageable.
