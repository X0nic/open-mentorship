**#OpenMentorship** is a simple concept: I'm donating my time and knowledge to anyone who could use it. Here are a few areas where I think I might be able to help:

- You want get into software development or DevOps but are unsure where to start
- You have questions on Ruby on Rails, React, or software development in general.
- You have built an app and want advice on how to get it live.
- You started freelancing and want some advice. I am new at this as well, so I will help where I can.

Our conversations can be about anything, there is no agenda. Ask for career advice, feedback on an idea or design , about my build tools, whatever. It's your time to do with as you wish, no strings attached, no fees.

## What do I stand to gain?

I want to help you, but I also want you to help me. Through our conversation I hope to gain insights and an understanding of backgrounds and challenges Iâ€™ve not experienced.


## Schedule

I've set aside two 30 minute blocks every Monday, you may book **only one** of these blocks per week. I plan to keep my availability open on Monday, but if you book less than a couple of days in advance I may have to cancel. If you view my calendar and there are no slots, drop me an email and we'll try work something out.
